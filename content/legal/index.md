## Privacy

This website doesn't process or store any personal information. Web server logs don't persist IP addresses.

For understanding basic visitor numbers, I'm using a self-hosted instance of [Rybbit](https://github.com/rybbit-io/rybbit), an open-source analytics project.

The setup is privacy-focused: it doesn't store IP addresses and uses a daily rotating salt for visitor identifiers.
